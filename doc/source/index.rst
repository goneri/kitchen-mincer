    Application:
        * Heat file + Heat components
        * Collection of medias (e.g: distribution repository)

    Marmitte: a application and environments
        * an application
        * collection of medias (e.g: Application backup to restore)
        * environnement (reference or in-line)

    Environnement:
        an account of an OpenStack cloud providing Heat API.

    Media:
        a file or VCS repository used by applications, the medias may be aggregated in a disk
        image. See `the medias`_ bellow.

    Provider: a driver for the cloud infrastructure we want to use
        * OpenStack+Heat (default)
        * OpenStack+Docker+Heat
        * late

    Identity:
        a set of credentials for the provider

    Mincer:
        The tool in charge of the initial deployment of the infrastructure

    Kitchen Island:
        A internal code name, restricted to be kept internally and not communicated outside.

Marmite definition
==================

The medias
----------

The word media is used to describe all resources out of the Marmitte. For example:

* a special operating system image available through HTTP
* a snapshot of a Ceph volume
* a database backup to restore stored in Swift
* a Ansible configuration directory from a git repository

We fetch these external resources and push them in images. Those medias are published as
image.

They must be prepared and uploaded before the stack startup because Heat will need them.

These medias can be either:

* in the application itself, e.g: a Fedora repository or an eDeploy image
* in the user configuration, e.g: a backup to restore or some additional configuration

Workflows
=========

Initial deployment
------------------

1. Step zero
    1. Initialize the Mincer (aka Mixer)
    2. load the Marmite
    3. load the Provider
2. Prepare the provider if needed (e.g: Docker)
3. Prepare media images (qcow2, raw)
    1. load the MediaManager object
    2. get the media list from the marmitte object
    3. fetch the media and produce the associated images
    4. upload the images in Glance and retrieve the image IDs
    5. Upload the keypairs
4. Compute the heat arguments (get image_id from MediaManager)
5. Call Heat with the arguments
6. Wait for stack being ready

Functional test
---------------

.. todo::

Sprint 4 -- Investigate the different method of testing, properly categorize them of what we want to do

Code architecture
=================

- The entry point of the application is the Main class.
- The Mincer class instantiates the Marmite object and load the provider specified
  in the marmite.yaml file.
- The MediaManager is in charge of collecting the medias from the marmitte and
  provisioning each images with the corresponding application code afterwards it
  push them as images in Glance.
- The Provider instantiates the MediaManager and start to deploy the application.
